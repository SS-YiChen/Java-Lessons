	SQL Tables
		-Primary Key: a column or set of columns that uniquely identity every row
        -Canidate Key: set of columns in a database that could be a primary key (reasonable choice)
        -Surrogate Key: a column or set of columns that can be used as a primary key in place of the primary key
						or to make one if none exists
		-Foreign Key: a reference to the primary key of another table

	Normalization - a way to reduce data redundancy and save on disk space
		- 3 forms that we will be covering:
			- 1st normal form (1NF): 
									1. Every row needs a primary key
									2. no repeating groups
			- 2nd normal form (2NF): 
									1. Must be in 1NF
                                    2. No Partial Dependencies
			- 3rd normal form (3NF): 
									1. Must be in 2NF
									2. No Transitive Dependencies (functional dependencies)
